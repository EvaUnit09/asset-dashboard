PDF Export errors:

Summary statistics should pull the same filtered information that we have set on the dashboard page. so total assets should only include Active, Stock, and Pending Rebuild.

Status Distribution pie chart should only show active stock and pending rebuild like the dashboard page.  

- Asset details chart remove from export. Create a seperate excel export for asset details so we can interact with the excel sheet instead of trying to size manage column sizes on the pdf.

Monthly asset trends chart in the x axis is unreadable due to having too many dates. They stack ontop of each other

Warranty Expiration Trends X axis is also very unreadable. 

Each chart should have its own page and title for separation.

In general everything on the main dashboard page is how it should look for the pdf export.
